# Aussie-Rules-Football-Dataset

During quarantine I began watching Aussie Rules Football. I went looking for datasets and only found one made in R.
I decided to make one myself and eventually put it on GitHub so people could see what I scraped and how I compiled the dataset in case they wanted to try one of their own in Python.
You can follow along the notebook and use some of the data to try and make predictions.
Almost all of the features are from footywire except for a couple which I added or altered a bit                                                                         

All of the data is sourced from https://www.footywire.com/
